# Tinder App Clone

Tinder App Clone is an iOS project made using the design of the Tinder App. The project uses SwiftUI in all it's awesome declarative-ness. 
When you run the project on a device, you'll find that it has a very fun UI and some of the animations and transitions are better 
than the real Tinder in my opinion. However, it is still just a side project so there is no backend such as authentication or persistence.
The data presented is just dummy data to get a good look at the UI.
